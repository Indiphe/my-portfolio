        Hello, I am Indiphe Yonwaba Nondlazi. I have recently completed my final year of a diploma in ICT,
         specializing in Applications Development, at Walter Sisulu University (BCC-Potsdam), and I am currently awaiting graduation. 

         As an ambitious and goal-driven individual, I am committed to personal and professional growth. I possess strong communication, 
         interpersonal, and leadership skills, coupled with resilience and the ability to multitask effectively. 

        To enhance my technical expertise, I have completed several extracurricular courses.
         I am now actively seeking IT job opportunities and internships to gain valuable industry exposure and experience, 
         with the aim of contributing meaningfully to the field.
