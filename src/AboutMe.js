            I recently completed my diploma in ICT with a specialization in Applications Development at Walter Sisulu University
             (BCC-Potsdam), and currently serve as a Software Development Associate at Capaciti, where Iâ€™ll continue 
             contributing for the rest of the year.

            Driven by a passion for growth and excellence, I bring strong communication, leadership, and interpersonal 
            skills, along with the ability to effectively manage multiple tasks.

             To strengthen my full stack development expertise, Iâ€™ve earned certifications in various technologies,
              allowing me to stay current with industry trends. While focused on my current role, Iâ€™m also exploring
              future IT job opportunities and internships to further refine my skills and make a meaningful impact in
              the field.
